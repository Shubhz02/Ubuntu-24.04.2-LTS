The Linux Operating System is a type of operating system that is similar to Unix, and it is built upon the Linux Kernel. 
The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources. 
It makes sure everything works smoothly and efficiently. But the Linux Kernel alone is not enough to make a complete operating system.
To create a full and functional system, the Linux Kernel is combined with a collection of software packages and utilities, which are together called Linux distributions.
These distributions make the Linux Operating System ready for users to run their applications and perform tasks on their computers securely and effectively.
Linux distributions come in different flavors, each tailored to suit the specific needs and preferences of users.



What is Linux?
  Linux is a free and open-source family of operating systems that is resilient and flexible. In 1991, an individual by the name as Linus Torvalds constructed it. 
The system’s source code is accessible to everyone for anyone to look at and change, making it cool that anyone can see how the system works. 
People from all across the world are urged to work together and keep developing Linux due to its openness.
  Since the beginning, Linux has grown into a dependable and safe OS that is used in an array of gadgets, including PCs, cell phones, and huge supercomputers. 
It is well-known for being cost-effective, which implies that employing it doesn’t cost a lot, and efficient, which indicates it can complete a lot of jobs quickly.

What is Linux Operating System?
Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991, the Linux operating system is a powerful and flexible open-source software platform. It acts as the basis for a variety of devices,
such embedded systems, cell phones, servers, and personal computers. Linux, that’s well-known for its reliability, safety, and flexibility, 
allows users to customize and improve their environment to suit specific needs. With an extensive and active community supporting it,
Linux is an appealing choice for people as well as companies due to its wealth of resources and constant developments.

How is the Linux Operating System Used
The Linux operating system is widely used across various domains due to its flexibility, security, and open-source nature:

-Servers and Hosting: Powers web servers, cloud infrastructure, and database management systems.
-Development: Used by developers for coding, debugging, and running applications.
-Desktop and Personal Use: Provides secure and customizable desktop environments.
-Cybersecurity: Essential for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security research.
